== Synopsis

Executable to delete files fitting certain criteria.

The intended purpose is to delete backups older than a certain date,
whilst keeping hourly, daily or weekly and so on backups.

Specifying an option like --hourly will keep the first file of the hour
and delete the rest of the files created within the same hour,
provided that the those files were created before the threshold date.

The executable does not itself create any backups, it is only
intended for cleaning up existing ones.
